# 🚲 XGB Bike Predictor

A modular and scalable Python project for predicting bike rentals using an XGBoost regressor and a custom preprocessing pipeline.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is focused on **writing clean, modular, production-ready code**, rather than on business KPIs or model performance optimization.
> Its main goal is to provide a structured, extensible pipeline for preprocessing, training, SHAP-based interpretation, and deployment.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository includes:

* A fully object-oriented and reusable preprocessing pipeline.
* Modular feature engineering components (e.g., binning, categorical encoding, custom time features).
* An extensible `Model` class, including XGBoost-specific functionality.
* Support for grid search with result export to Excel.
* SHAP integration for model interpretability.
* Serialization of both the model and preprocessing pipeline with `pickle`.
* A generation module using LLMs to interpret model predictions.
* FastAPI endpoints for external usage (⚠️ **still under development**).

---

## 🧩 Module Breakdown

### 🛠 `preprocessing.py`

Manages preprocessing logic with a chain of transformations (e.g., scaling, encoding, new variable creation). Every transformation is implemented as a separate class for flexibility.

### 🔄 `postprocessing.py`

Performs postprocessing on prediction inputs before passing them to interpretation modules (e.g., SHAP explanation binning).

### 📦 `modell.py`

Contains the abstract `Model` class and a concrete `XgBoost` implementation. Handles training, grid search, prediction, SHAP computation, and model persistence.

### 🧬 `schemas.py`

Defines Pydantic schemas used to validate inputs and outputs for FastAPI. Ensures structured and validated data.

### 🌐 `API2.py`

Implements RESTful endpoints via FastAPI:

* `/grid_search`: to tune model hyperparameters
* `/training`: to train and persist the model
* `/predict`: to make predictions on new data

> ⚠️ **Note**: These endpoints are a work in progress. Minor refactoring or adjustments may still be needed.

### 🧠 `llm.py`

Uses an LLM (e.g., via Ollama) to generate natural language interpretations of predictions based on SHAP values and feature descriptions.

### ✅ `unittest_model.py`

Provides unit tests for key components in the model and preprocessing logic. Helps ensure robustness, consistency, and easier debugging.

## 🧪 Example Usage

To run a complete pipeline from training to prediction:

1. Load your dataset (e.g., `hour.csv`)
2. Apply preprocessing
3. Train the XGBoost model
4. Make predictions
5. Use SHAP and LLM modules to explain the results

Scripts and examples can be adapted for batch predictions, experiments, or deployment scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Running the API

Install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

Launch the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn API2:api --reload --port 8000
```

Change the port if needed (e.g., 5000).
Then visit: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for interactive documentation.

> 🔧 **Note**: You may need to adjust import paths in the source code depending on your local file structure. Paths reflect the original developer’s environment.

---

## 📁 Files Included

* `hour.csv`: Sample dataset for training and testing.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
* `jsons/`: Folder expected to contain `examples.json` and `mapping.json` used for prompt generation and SHAP interpretation.

## 🧠 Final Notes

This project is designed for **developers and data scientists** who want a clean foundation to build custom, explainable machine learning pipelines. Feel free to adapt modules to your needs, extend them, or plug in different models.
