# üö≤ XGB Bike Predictor

A modular and scalable Python project for predicting bike rentals using an XGBoost regressor and a custom preprocessing pipeline.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is not focused on business case analysis or model performance interpretation, but rather on **creating clean, production-ready, and extensible Python code** for preprocessing, training, and deployment.

## üìå Overview

This repository provides:

- A fully object-oriented preprocessing pipeline.
- Modular feature engineering components (e.g., wind binning, temporal encoding).
- A custom `Model` class structure, with full XGBoost support.
- Grid search for hyperparameter tuning and result export to Excel.
- Serialization of both model and pipeline using `pickle`.
- Example training and prediction scripts in a reproducible pipeline.
